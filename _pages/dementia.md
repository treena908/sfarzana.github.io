<p><strong>Dementia Detection</strong><br>

  <ul>
    <li>We experiment with domain adaptation (DA) techniques on heterogeneous spoken<br>
language data to evaluate generalizability across diverse datasets for a common<br>
task: dementia detection. We empirically find that the feature-augmented<br>
DA method achieves a 22% increase in accuracy adapting from a conversational<br>
to task-specific dataset compared to a jointly trained baseline.</li>
    <li>Annotated conversational data with Dialog-Act (DA) tags from two different cognitive<br>
tasks of DementiaBank dataset, proposed task-agnostic Dementia detection <br>
framework leveraging the annotations, and achieved competitive performance relative <br>
to the models trained on a specific cognitive task.</li>
    <li>An automated system to predict MMSE scores reflecting individuals’ cognitive <br>
health status, based on their free speech samples from conversational interviews. <br>
The models experiment with traditional machine learning algorithms, pre-trained <br>
language model, and the best performing model achieved 16.5% decrease in <br>
RMSE score from the linguistic benchmark of the baseline paper in ADReSS <br>
Challenge2020.</li>
