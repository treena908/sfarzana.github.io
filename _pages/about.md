Hello! This is Shahla Farzana! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at University of Illinois Chicago (UIC).
My research interest is in the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Health Infomatics.
I am currently a part of the Natural Language Processing lab at UIC, working under the supervision of Dr. Natalie Parde.

My primary research interests are in: (1) developing and evaluating multi-modal and multi-lingual (speech and text) computational approaches for low-resource tasks in cognitive and behavioral health, and (2) dialogue systems and their applications.
The overarching goal of my research is to leverage the
power of data and the advancement in AI to build automated, accessible systems for cognitive,
psychological well-being as well as for social good.
