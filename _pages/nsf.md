<p><strong>Smart and Connected Family Engagement for Equitable Early Intervention Service Design</strong><br>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>collaborating with researchers from UIC's College of Applied Health Sciences <br> 
on designing and implementing a chatbot to customize caregiver navigation when using a <br>
web-based application prototype known as the Participation and Environment Measure (PEM+). <br>
In addition to making this application more tailored to a diverse set of stakeholders, <br>
part of this process also involves developing automated techniques to facilitate solution-focused <br>
caregiver strategy exchange for personalized pediatric rehabilitation service design.</li>
    <li>Thus far, we have prototyped this chatbot using Google DialogFlow with an FAQ dataset <br>
specifically collected from real-world end users (caregiver using PEM+). We are currently working on <br> 
extending the chatbot to facilitate caregiver strategy exchange using a opensource framework <br>
known as OpenDial.</li>
    <li>For training the dialog manager of the chatbot,  we have annotated a corpus containing <br>
early intervention strategies categorized into four broader classes based on key, clinically validated <br> 
drivers of participation. Using the corpus we plan to train the dialog manger of our chatbot to <br>
recommend personalized  early intervention strategies to parents and caregivers and in turn <br>
conduct human evaluations on the extended prototype.</li>
